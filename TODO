FUTURE:
  - Rewrite JavaScript to be TypeScript ?

  Ideas:
    - Mono, single color, full color? versioning?
    - Sizes? Paths? Avg?
    - Outline version? Filled version?
    - Should have a website?
    - fill-rule="evenodd" can go on paths, doesn't need to go on SVG tag
    - fill="currentColor"
